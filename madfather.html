  <p style="color:#fff"><i>Mad Father</i> is the game I played last in this series. The premise is intriguing--a mad scientist father who abuses patients and the daughter who finds out about it. Very disturbing, but very intriguing! I'm not sure that I can claim that this game actually <i>says</i> anything about abuse or family dynamics (or, if it does, it's rather lukewarm/shallow and not worth talking about), but it is a fun game to play.
    <p style="color:#fff"> The setting of this game is also one of the more fun settings that I've discussed on this site so far. <i>Ib</i>'s art museum is creative, for sure, and the game uses that to its advantage, but there's something so familiarly unsettling and spooky about a <b>Victorian mansion</b>. Every character has Victorian outfits, and the whole game has a <b>gothic</b>, Sweeny-Todd-esque feel about it. I love it. I think it's perfect for the <b>mad scientist</b> story they're trying to tell.
      <p style="color:#fff"> Despite the premise being more disturbing than the other two games being discussed here, however, I would say this one is the least troubling in terms of how it makes you feel. It's a fun, shocking romp that never quite feels entirely realistic, which, in this case, makes it more effective at simply being <b>entertainment</b>, in my opinion. It would be a very good game to play with a mug of hot chocolate and a close friend.
