  <p style="color:#fff"><i>The Witch's House</i> was the first <b>RPGMAKER horror</b> game I ever played, when I was in eighth grade. I became obsessed with it for months in the summer; I watched every YouTube playthrough I could, and made all of my friends play it with me. It's become a bit of a joke in my friend circles--if I make a new friend, the first time we hang out one-on-one, I always make them play this game. No exceptions, even to this day.
    <p style="color:#fff"> I'm not entirely sure why I was so taken with this game. Perhaps because it was the first of its kind that I'd experienced--small-scale, indie Japanese games with intriguing settings and storylines made only out of <b>pixels</b>. The aesthetic is <i>awesome</i>, to be sure, and really sets the tone of the story right out the gate; it's mastery of the jumpscare, something which I abhor, surprised me, because every time one happened it genuinely felt deserved. The puzzles are also fascinating and function as an exceptional foray into <b>environmental storytelling</b>.
      <p style="color:#fff"> This game also, I should note, has a <b>twist ending</b>. There are different endings you can get--good, bad, and neutral, if memory serves. It is one of very few cases that I've felt that the twist ending was deserved, that it was actually a payoff of moments I hadn't noticed until discovering the secret, a surprisingly effective use of Chekhov's gun. At the risk of sounding juvenile--or, worse, a supporter of <i>gamer YouTubers</i>--I remember watching user Markiplier play this game, and he had this to say after finishing it:
        <blockquote style="color:#fff"> "This was an amazing game, you know, I said at the beginning of this Let's Play that I felt bad that I kinda havne't played these RPG Horror games in a while because I didn't think they'd be scary, but <i>man</i> I was <i>wrong!</i> That was probably one of the best horror experiences that I've had in a long time. Because the jumpscares were nice, the atmosphere was perfect, and once you get into it... You kinda have to play it for yourself. I would recommend--if anyone is still skeptical about these games, like I understand, I was too! But <i>give it a try!</i> Play it for yourself!"</blockquote>
        <p style="color:#fff">I completely agree.</p>
