  <p style="color:#fff"><i>Ib</i> is perhaps the most popular game out of the three I've listed. People still make fanart of the characters from time to time, which is something I can't say the same for the other games. It is much more <b>character-based</b> than either <i>The Witch's House</i> or <i>Mad Father</i>, which certainly has something to do with that mode of engagement with it.
    <p style="color:#fff"> The surrealism of <i>Ib</i> is the first thing many point to as its strong point, and I have to say that I completely agree--it takes place in an <b>art museum</b>, after all, and chronicles the thoughts of a very troubled artist. Therefore, most aspects of the game attempt to capture the scrambled, disturbing state of that artists' mind through a combination of established horror imagery and more symbolic, uncanny, and unsettling tones. Sound and music--or, sometimes, a lack thereof--play an instrumental (hah) role in cultivating this aesthetic.
      <p style="color:#fff"> For many, this game served as an <b>introduction</b> to RPGMAKER horror, and I believe it is quite a good one. It showcases very effective use of some of the hallmarks of the genre; solid and unique characterization, puzzles, unsettling atmosphere, expected-but-not jumpscares, and a female protagonist, to name a few. Not many games in this category have deviated from these elements. This isn't meant to imply that <i>Ib</i> was the first game to do this, as it almost certainly wasn't, but it <i>is</i> one of the best versions of it by far. Most other RPGMAKER horror games cannot compare.
